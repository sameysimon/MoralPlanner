# The Machine Ethics Hypothetical Retrospection (MEHR) Planner.

This is a hybrid Python and C++ project for generating and solving ethical decision-making problems in various Multi-Moral Markov Decision Processes (MMMDPs) and Multi-Moral Stochastic Shortest Path Problems (MMSSPs). It integrates Multi-Objective AO* planning algorithm and moral theories including Utilitarianism and Deontology.

MMMDP environments are given to the planner in a JSON format. To create JSON MDP files, use the `EnvironmentBuilder` Python package. It is tested with Python 3.12.2, though most versions should work fine. Only the *argparse* package is required for environment generation.


**To execute the Lost Insulin experiments featured in our AAMAS 2025 paper**, use the `RunInsulinExperiments.py` script. It contains a list of dicts `configs` that allow you to modify experiment parameters (moral theories, rankings, horizon etc.)
It will (re-)generate environment files for each configuration and call the planner 5 times. Results are stored in the `Data/Experiments/LostInsulin` directory. Results are summarised in `experiments_out.csv`, `theoryResults.csv` and `theoryTimes.csv` in the same folder. You will need the [`Pandas`](https://pandas.pydata.org/) and [`NumPy`](https://numpy.org/) Python packages for this to work.


The Planner is implemented in C++ 17. A `CMakeLists.txt` file is included and we use the [`nlohmann_json`](https://github.com/nlohmann/json) library for importing JSON environments. For testing, we also use the [`Google Tests`](https://github.com/google/googletest) library.

```bash
cd EnvironmentBuilder
python -m EnvironmentBuilder --config config.json
```

| **Argument**         | **Type**       | **Required** | **Description**                                                                                             |

### Generating random Python Environments

Generate random abstract environments for testing
```bash
cd MoralPlanner
python3 -m EnvironmentBuilder.MDPFactory --branchFactor <int> --actionFactor <int> --horizon <int> --theories <list> [options] -- <output_file>
```
This table sums it up!

### Running the Planner

Execute the planner:

```bash
cd build
./MPlan ../Data/your_fun_path/exampleMMMDP.json
```

| **Argument**    | **Type** | **Required** | **Description**                                                                                       |
|------------------|----------|--------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `<input_file>`   | `string` | Yes          | Path to the environment input file. This file must be in JSON format and define the MDP structure.    |
| `<output_file>`  | `string` | Yes          | Path to the output file where results will be saved. The output will include policies and MEHR data.  |


### Running Experiments from the paper
Use the Python script to re-run the experiments from our paper.
```bash
python3 MoralPlanner/run_experiments.py
```
Results will be generated in directory `MoralPlanner/Data/Experiments/<YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS>`. Inside there will be all the raw output as JSON files as well as `experiments_out.csv` collecting results and `grouped_experiments_out.csv`. 

### Running Unit Tests

Run the included tests:

```bash
# Assuming MPlan is built in directory 'build'
cd MPlan/build/
ctest
```
